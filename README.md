# Objective

For this student project, I assumed the role of a data analyst contracted by the Business Intelligence (BI) division of Rockbuster Stealth to contribute to the launch strategy for their new online video service. My primary responsibility involved providing data-driven solutions to various departments, ranging from inventory management to customer insights. The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board had presented a series of business inquiries, and they anticipated receiving data-backed responses to inform their 2020 company strategy.

# Data
